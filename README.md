Hi, I’m Mack Ragland, thanks for taking the time to get to know me better. 

- 📚 I'm a mechanical engineering graduate, but my focus is in programming and electronics. After graduating, I joined an automation and controls company, programming PLCs, troubleshooting electronics, and coordinating with clients.

- 🦾 I was successful programming PLCs within automation and controls companies, leading teams and helping design industrial algorithms, but I knew I had untapped potential, and wanted to join a more challenging and creative role, and so I joined a robotics startup. There, I deployed humanoid robots throughout the USA, tested and troubleshooted our product while being a company representative. I worked with ROS2, Linux command line, Bash, Wifi, and network analysis.

- Unfortunately, the startup hit some funding roadblocks, and since I was the most recent employee hired, I was laid off.

- 👀 After regrouping, I took this opportunity to further my programming abilities. So, while I was already performing PLC programming and robotics software troubleshooting, I needed to take the next step in my abilities in order to program full time.  I built a plan to prepare myself for an immersive life of programming using Python and C++, and have spent 8 hours a day developing these skills for the past 4 months. 

- 🌱 In that time I've built a chess computer player, analyzing 43,000 positions a second. 
  -  Chess engine development logs found here in "main" branch: https://github.com/MackR/ChessEngine/blob/main/src/ProgressLogAndNotes.txt
- 🌱 I also taught myself computer vision (OpenCV) with 170hrs of practice
  - Daily OpenCV notes found here in "master" branch: https://github.com/MackR/LearningCV/blob/master/OpenCV_Lessons.txt

- ✔️ You'll find that I'm extremely well organized, sociable, and easy to work with on projects with little supervision. 

- I've been promoted twice within two different companies to lead teams of programmers. My managers have trusted me with independence, and to lead others to success. Within your organization, you will find I'm perfectly suited to scale to greater roles and responsibilities as your team develops. 

- 📫 Now that I've achieved my 4 month development goals, I'm looking to join an innovative company where I can employ my discipline, intellectual skills, and creative talents to create amazing new innovations, and within 4-5 years would like to become a senior software engineer.

Feel free to reach me at rtfmack@gmail.com and we can both learn more about eachother.
